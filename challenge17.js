Algorithm Challenge - Single Number
Define a function that takes in two non-negative integers a and b and returns the last decimal digit of a^b. Note that a and b may be very large!

For example, the last decimal digit of 9^7
is 9, since 9^7 = 4782969

please take 0^0 to be 1.

You may assume that the input will always be valid.
Examples
  lastDigit("4", "1")            // returns 4
  lastDigit("4", "2")            // returns 6
  lastDigit("9", "7")            // returns 9
